The Java Point of Sale (POS) System is a straightforward yet robust application designed to facilitate sales transactions for small businesses. Built using Java, this system allows users to input essential product details, including price, description, and quantity, and automatically calculates the total cost for the transaction. By simulating the basic operations of a typical retail POS system, it is an ideal solution for small-scale retail environments, pop-up shops, or student projects.

This POS system provides users with a seamless way to track and process product sales. Each product entered is stored in memory during runtime, and the system continuously updates the grand total as more items are added. It generates a final receipt that summarizes the items sold, their prices, and quantities, as well as the overall total.

The current implementation is console-based but offers a flexible foundation for adding more advanced features like tax calculation, discount handling, and integration with a database for transaction storage. Future improvements could also include creating a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing.

This project is perfect for developers who are new to Java or for those looking to better understand object-oriented programming concepts, file handling, and user interaction within a simple yet practical application.
